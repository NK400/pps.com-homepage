              <p>
                I am by nature a "yeller." I was using yelling and consequences to
                deal with challenging behaviors ... My household just felt so
                negative. I felt like I was constantly battling with my kids. I
                felt like they did not respect me at all, and I ended most days
                feeling pretty bummed out.
              </p>
              <p>
                [Since PPS], I am not exaggerating: Our household has been
                transformed. I am calmer, the kids are thriving, and I have
                watched tool after tool [from PPS] work.

                I now have the Positive Parenting Solutions’ Toolbox list taped to

              <p>
                Founder of Positive Parenting Solutions, best-selling author,
                mother of two ... and "recovering yeller."
              </p>

              <p>
                Don't let my sunny smile fool you: Before I learned how to get
                my two sons to listen, I used to yell myself hoarse nearly every
                day.
              </p>

              <p>
                Like you, I never imagined I would turn into "That Yelling Mom"
                ... but I was trapped in a vicious cycle:
              </p>

              <p>
                I’d ask my kids to do something in my nicest voice ... and
                nothing would happen. So I'd repeat myself. And remind them.
              </p>

              <p>... And repeat and remind and repeat and remind ...</p>

              <p>
                Until eventually, inevitably, I would lose it and blow up at
                them ... turning into The Big Ugly Yelling Mom AGAIN.
              </p>

              <p>
                It was a never-ending cycle I couldn’t escape. I was at the end
                of my rope and CONSTANTLY disappointed in myself for the parent
                I had become.
              </p>

              <p>Sound familiar? I'm sure you can relate.</p>

              <p>
                It wasn't until I discovered the power of positive parenting
                strategies that I finally understood why yelling, nagging, and
                threats just don’t work as a parenting strategy.
              </p>

              <p>
                What I learned completely changed my family, and it can change
                yours, too.
